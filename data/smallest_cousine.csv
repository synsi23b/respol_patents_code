In one embodiment, an optical guide (e.g., using a laser) is used to define a desired path; sensors mounted to the component dynamically detect deviation from this path, with this deviation then being used to drive the transducers to immediately counteract the deviation. This error correction scheme can be applied to correct for more than type of transport error, for example, to correct for error in a substrate transport path, a printhead transport path and/or split-axis transport non-orthogonality.",0.6614760760003835,0.019358696,0.029265905,0,0,0,0,0,0,84,84
