The transaction managing system first determines the identity of the target resource from the transactions commands, and compares this with all the resources that it knows it manages itself. If the target resource is managed by the transaction processing system itself, then the transaction command is passed to a resource manager within the transaction managing system itself. If the transaction managing system does not recognize the resource then it sends a query message to each external resource manager to determine if any of these recognize the resource. If one of the external resource managers send an ownership message back to the transactions managing system admitting ownership of the target resource then the transaction command is passed to that external resource manager for processing.

For a replicated and distributed database across a network of computers, the network is divided or partitioned into sites that are islands of good network connectivity wherein communication between the site computers occurs using high bandwidth, low-latency remote procedure calls (RPCs). Further, intersite connections allow communication between servers of different sites using a low bandwidth, high-latency store and forward messaging scheme. Knowledge consistency checkers running independently on each individual server in the entire network assures that the servers within a site are automatically connected in a full-mesh replication topology within a site and that the sites themselves are connected via a spanning tree of intersite links. The knowledge consistency checker enforced replication topology ensures that replication changes will be transmitted over intersite links as efficiently as possible so that each change will be transmitted over each ""expensive"" intersite link exactly once across a single direction in order to attain the minimum communication that must occur in order for all servers to be informed of such a change. A change arriving at a site replicates according to the intrasite replication mechanism. ",1.716467604,0.01981983,0.011546871,1,5,15,177,5,36,446,2465

The dynamic expansion of the identifier reduces the number of log entries required where file or directory objects are renamed. The transaction log is optimized as each transaction is inserted or appended on the client. The optimization process eliminates transactions that are rendered invalid or superfluous by the most recent transaction. The dynamic expansion feature allows RENAME transactions to be optimized because MKDIR and CREATE transactions automatically are expanded to the new file system object name, eliminating the need to log the RENAME transaction. Successive RENAME transactions are folded into a single RENAME transaction to reduce log size and playback resource requirements. ",1.699768368,0.010571511,0.006219383,1,6,9,47,4,29,121,580

The visual element manager builder is a visual development environment in which device vendors or network managers may create standardized element management applications, called element managers. A user can build an element manager without writing any computer code. In addition, a user can edit an element manager without writing any computer code. A graphic user interface of this invention, that is displayed by the client, includes a visual image of a computer network element being managed. As a user looks at the visual display in the graphic user interface, the user is provided the same visual information as if the user where physically present at the location of the managed computer network element. Thus, at a glance, a user can obtain considerable information about the status of the computer network element as represented by the visual display.",1.693557554,0.018540516,0.010947674,0,0,1,12,1,13,8,68

Each database version vector keeps track of the total number of updates to any data items in its respective database replica and from which server those updates were originally performed. During replication between two replicas, the database version vectors of the replicas are compared to efficiently determine if update replication is necessary. If the database version vectors are not identical, the server possessing the more recent version of the data items propagates those data items to the server whose replica is older using conventional update propagation techniques. Identical database version vectors indicate that update propagation is not necessary. As such, the protocol avoids examining every data item in the database in order to determine the necessity of update propagation, which is required in conventional replication protocols.

1233468,5548646,System for signatureless transmission and reception of data packets between computer networks," A system for automatically encrypting and decrypting data packet sent from a source host to a destination host across a public internetwork. A tunnelling bridge is positioned at each network, and intercepts all packets transmitted to or from its associated network. The tunnelling bridge includes tables indicated pairs of hosts or pairs of networks between which packets should be encrypted. When a packet is transmitted from a first host, the tunnelling bridge of that host's network intercepts the packet, and determines from its header information whether packets from that host that are directed to the specified destination host should be encrypted; or, alternatively, whether packets from the source host's network that are directed to the destination host's network should be encrypted. If so, the packet is encrypted, and transmitted to the destination network along with an encapsulation header indicating source and destination information: either source and destination host addresses, or the broadcast addresses of the source and destination networks (in the latter case, concealing by encryption the hosts' respective addresses). An identifier of the source network's tunnelling bridge may also be included in the encapsulation header. At the destination network, the associated tunnelling bridge intercepts the packet, inspects the encapsulation header, from an internal table determines whether the packet was encrypted, and from either the source (host or network) address or the tunnelling bridge identifier determines whether and how the packet was encrypted. If the packet was encrypted, it is now decrypted using a key stored in the destination tunnelling bridge's memory, and is sent on to the destination host. The tunnelling bridge identifier is used particularly in an embodiment where a given network has more than one tunnelling bridge, and hence multiple possible encryption/decryption schemes and keys. In an alternative embodiment, the automatic encryption and decryption may be carried out by the source and destination hosts themselves, without the use of additional tunnelling bridges, in which case the encapsulation header includes the source and destination host addresses.

Initially, all users access a network resource through the server identified in the replicated database as being the primary server for the network resource. When server resident processes detect a failure of the primary server, the replicated database is updated to reflect the failure of the primary server, and to change the affiliation of the network resource from its primary to its backup server. This remapping occurs transparently to whichever user/client is accessing the network resource. As a result of the remapping, all users access the network resource through the server identified in the replicated database as the backup server for the resource. When the server resident processes detect a return to service of the primary server, the replicated database is again updated to reflect the resumed operation of the primary server. This remapping of network resource affiliations also occurs transparently to whichever user/client is accessing the network resource, and returns the resource to its original fault tolerant state.

1317989,5634122,System and method for multi-level token management for distributed file systems," A system and method for controlling access to shared resources in a distributed computer system. Access to shared resources is controlled by a local authorization token manager. Only computer processes holding authorization tokens for the requested operation may perform that operation. Each requested operation checks for the proper token. If the token is not held by the process, it is requested. The local token manager resolves token conflicts before granting tokens. A token manager of a distributed file system export protocol also is able to request authorization tokens from the local token manager. The export protocol token manager controls authorization tokens for that particular distributed file system protocol. Multiple different export protocols may request tokens from the local token manager. The shared resources may therefore be shared by multiple different export protocols without conflict. Local processes and processes requesting shared resource operations through an export protocol that does not itself manage tokens are granted tokens through the operation token request mechanism. This mechanism enables local processes to use shared resources without the performance penalty of having to request through a local distributed client process.

The system includes client computers for executing the application programs and server computers for executing ""server programs"", programs which carry out the called functions. The client and server computers communicate through a network. To make a function call, an application program running on a client computer generates an argument for the function and sends a request identifying the function to a ""client gate"" program also running on the client program. Each client computer stores a configuration file indicating which server star carries out each function, and which server computer can execute that server star. When the client gate receives the function request, it consults the configuration file and then sends a request referencing the identified server star and function to a ""server gate"" program executed by the identified server. The server gate thereupon invokes the server star which carries out the function. The server gate forwards function output data produced by the server star to the client gate which returns the data to the application program. Thus a change in the network location or structure of a data file used by application programs can be accommodated by modifying configuration files and/or the server stars without necessarily altering the application programs themselves.

The genetic engineering process is based on the use of spontaneous DNA reorganisation in the recombinant live vaccine, such that the recombinant live vaccine spontaneously divides into two subpopulations (A and B), whereby subpopulation A is capable of infecting and acts immunogenically per se as a minimum characteristic and subpopulation B as a minimum characteristic is regenerated by subpopulation A, produces additional antigen and acts immunogenically with respect to said additional antigen. The formation of two subpopulations of the live vaccine ensures, on the one hand, that the infection process necessary for the induction of an immune response takes place and, on the other hand, that the formation of additional antigen by a hybrid live vaccine does not disturb the infection process in order to finally achieve an effective immune response to the additional antigen and the pathogen cross-reacting therewith.

2054979,6377691,Challenge-response authentication and key exchange for a connectionless security protocol,"The disclosed system uses a challenge-response authentication protocol for datagram-based remote procedure calls. Using a challenge-response authentication protocol has many advantages over using a conventional authentication protocol. There are two primary components responsible for communication using the challenge-response protocol: a challenge-response protocol component on the client computer (client C-R component) and a challenge-response protocol component on the server computer (server C-R component). In order to start a session using the challenge-response protocol, the client C-R component first generates a session key. The session key is used by both the client C-R component and the server C-R component for encrypting and decrypting messages. After creating the session key, the client C-R component encrypts a message containing a request for a remote procedure call and sends it to the server C-R component. In response, the server C-R component sends a challenge to the client C-R component. The challenge contains a unique identifier generated by the server C-R component. The client C-R component responds to the challenge by sending a challenge response and the session key. The challenge response is the unique identifier contained within the challenge encrypted with the password of the user of the client computer. The session key is also encrypted using this password. Upon receiving the challenge response, the server C-R component uses its copy of the client's password to create its own version of the challenge response and compares it to the version received from the client C-R component. If the two versions of the challenge response are identical, the identity of the user of the client computer has been verified. If the two versions are not identical, an attempted unauthorized access has been detected. After verification, the server C-R component extracts the session key, decrypts the message, and invokes the requested procedure of the server program. Subsequently, the server C-R component will send and receive encrypted messages from the client C-R component, thereby facilitating a remote procedure call.",1.664983277,0.022000458,0.013213621,1,11,11,160,15,93,281,3838

Due to execution transfers to computed destination addresses that are not determined prior to program execution, it is not possible to include all of the program instructions in the flowgraph. Execution transfers to these computed destinations are coded as calls to an interpreter that interprets the untranslated code. Returns are made from the interpreter to block entry points that are the first instructions in the blocks. Moreover, information about the location of untranslated instructions in an original program is discovered during execution of a partial translation of the program, and that information is used later during retranslation of the original program. This information includes origin addresses of translated instructions and corresponding destination address of untranslated instructions of execution transfers that occur during the execution of the partial translation. This feedback of information from execution to retranslation is performed after each execution of the translated program so that virtually all of the instructions in the original program will eventually be located and translated.

Transparency between system entry services and account management services, including authentication, password, account, and session services, is provided by an application programming interface and a configuration file. The configuration file stores associations between system entry services, and selected account management services, and allows an individual system entry service to be associated with multiple different ones of a given type of account management service, such as authentication services. The application programming interface determines dynamically in response to a request by a system entry service for an account management operation, such as authentication of a user, which account management service is associated with the system entry service by reading the configuration file and queuing pathnames stored therein of the account management services associated with the system entry service currently connecting user to the system. The application programming interface then invokes the queued pathnames for the desired operation. Multiple login is provided by encrypting authentication tokens used by the authentication services associated with a given system entry service with a primary authentication token of one of the authentication services, and subsequently decrypting the encrypted tokens as needed to authenticate the user. With unified login, the user need only provide the primary authentication token. Unified logout is provided by locating and destroying credentials of the user created by the multiple authentication services in response to a request of the valid user to logout.

Rather than selectively updateing individual files, a user simply zupdate's whole trees of files. When it comes time to edit files, a user makes use of standard history managed file system commands to obtain a writable copy of a file. Use of one of these commands destroys a zymlink corresponding to the file, and substitutes a privately owned copy of the file on a user's disk. When the edited file is checked back into the history managed file system, a read-only copy of the file remains on a user's disk. When a user updates his or her file system, the read-only file copy may be replaced with a new zymlink. A user will normally view current versions of shared files. Rather than viewing current versions of shared files, a user may wish to maintain a static view of file versions by issuing a zreset command. The system provides a user with more free disk space than in conventional history managed systems. ",1.652910317,0.011435123,0.006918175,0,0,8,73,4,16,86,302

A management policy having a variety of alternative styles and contexts is provided. Each licensed product upon start-up makes a call to a license server to check on whether usage is permitted, and the license server checks a database of the licenses, called product use authorizations, that it administers. If the particular use requested is permitted, a grant is returned to the requesting user node. The product use authorization is structured to define a license management policy allowing a variety of license alternatives by values called ""style"", ""context"", ""duration"" and ""usage requirements determination method"". The license administration may be delegated by the license server to a subsection of the organization, by creating another license management facility duplicating the main facility. The license server must receive a license document (a product use authorization) from an issuer of licenses, where a license document generator is provided. A mechanism is provided for one user node to make a call to use a software product located on another user node; this is referred to as a ""calling card"", by which a user node obtains permission to make a procedure call to use a program on another node. A management interface allows a license manager at a server to modify the license documents in the database maintained by the server, within the restraints imposed by the license, to make delegations, assignments, etc. The license documents are maintained in a standard format referred to as a license document interchange format so the management system is portable and can be used by all adhering software vendors.

Then, the first event handler determines if the second event handler in the sequence should be notified of the event. If so, the second event handler in the sequence receives the event notification, handles the event, and then determines if the third event handler in the sequence should be notified. In this manner, the event notification can be propagated from event handler to event handler in the sequence, but any event handler in the sequence which receives the notification can block subsequent propagation of the event notification. This technique saves processing time in situations where some or all of the event handlers in the sequence (after the first event handler) may not benefit from the event notification; in such a case, the event notification is not propagated to them.
